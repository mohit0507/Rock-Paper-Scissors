The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game that can be played in two exciting modes. This project not only allows players to enjoy the traditional game but also offers the functionality to save game data to MySQL database and files for future reference, as per the user's request. This allows players to save their game history, including the outcomes of each round, the choices made by each player, and the timestamps of each game session.
